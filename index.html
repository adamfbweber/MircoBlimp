<p id="txtstuff">Creating the mircobit code was a bit of a frustrating task as the limitations with the number of signals they can receive was a hindrance. However, when we switched to just making the one microbit control both motors, it became significantly easier. The way the code works is by setting an angle range that the servo can swing between. Then using the inputs for the A and B buttons we could either tap it to move the angle 3 degrees, or by structuring the loops correctly and holding the button, it would swing smoothly from side to side. The only issue with out code is that if you hold the button for too long, the angle value could drop below zero or above 180. Causing you to have to hold the opposite button until itâ€™s within range again. If given more time I would have fixed the bug, but the system works well regardless.</p>
